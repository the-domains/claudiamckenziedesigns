ABOUT

Hello! My name s Claudia McKenzie and I am a Vancouver based graphic designer graduated from Vancouver College of Art and design (VCAD). I am a full time Freelancer, and It was an easy choice, mostly because I love to collaborate and get to wok with wonderful people, and companies. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/57cf8caa-b5e8-4dc5-b031-673740e2ba1c.jpg)

As a Graphic Designer, I have a passion for illustration, branding, lettering & photography. All creations start from a blank canvas. I find you are always creating something from nothing to a uniformed original state. It is the appreciation for this type of creativity, of art and design, which is most gratifying.
